## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Attribute Mapping

**User Story:** As a player, I want the UI to automatically display all my game attributes, so that I can monitor any resource type the game introduces without UI updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Game_State contains player attributes, THE Resource_Panel SHALL iterate through all key-value pairs using Object.entries() and render a monitoring unit for each attribute
2. THE Resource_Panel SHALL NOT hardcode any specific attribute names (e.g., "金钱", "原材料", "影响力")
3. WHEN a new attribute is added to Game_State during gameplay, THE Resource_Panel SHALL automatically render a new monitoring unit without code changes
4. THE Resource_Panel SHALL display attribute name, current value, and optional progress indicator for each attribute

### Requirement 2: Multi-Entity Scaling

**User Story:** As a game host, I want the system to support any number of players (2 to N), so that I can run games with different group sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
